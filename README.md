# Search-Filter Params

This is a demo and proof of concept for restructuring search filter
setups in big ecommerce stores or large websites to avoid creating
massive amounts of low-value documents and preventing search engine
bots from getting lost and giving up.

This code is still a WIP and at this point none of the code has been
tested for production use. If you decide to use it, please do so with
caution.
